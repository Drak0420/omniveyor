The {\ttfamily rosconsole} logging system (the R\+O\+S\+\_\+\+I\+N\+F\+O/\+W\+A\+R\+N/\+E\+R\+R\+O\+R/... macros) is very useful for aggregating all logging output of R\+OS nodes in a single place (the {\ttfamily /rosout} topic).

However, the topic usually has high bandwidth consisting of very small messages, which makes it hard to transmit over the network.

{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+log\+\_\+transport} contains a sender node, which sends aggregates log messages at fixed intervals, and a receiver node, which publishes the information on {\ttfamily /rosout} again.

Note that the sender node uses a circular buffer for aggregating messages, and thus will drop messages if the bandwidth is too high.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_log_transport_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Sender}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_log_transport_README_autotoc_md3}
