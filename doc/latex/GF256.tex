This module provides efficient implementations of bulk G\+F(2$^\wedge$$^\wedge$8) math operations over memory buffers.

Addition is done over the base field in G\+F(2) meaning that addition is X\+OR between memory buffers.

Multiplication is performed using table lookups via S\+I\+MD instructions. This is somewhat slower than X\+OR, but fast enough to not become a major bottleneck when used sparingly.
