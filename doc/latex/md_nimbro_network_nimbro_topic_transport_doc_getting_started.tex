We assume that we have two machines, machineA and machineB. Both will be running roscores, and we will transport some topics from machineA to machineB.

On machineA\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch nimbro\_topic\_transport sender.launch target:=machineB}
\DoxyCodeLine{rostopic pub -\/r 1.0 /my\_first\_topic std\_msgs/String "Hello World"}
\end{DoxyCode}


Instead of using the host name {\ttfamily machineB}, you can also use an IP address.

On machineB\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch nimbro\_topic\_transport udp\_receiver.launch}
\DoxyCodeLine{rostopic echo /recv/my\_first\_topic}
\end{DoxyCode}


You should see the {\ttfamily Hello World} messages arriving. Note that the topics are remapped to a /recv/ prefix, since the topics would conflict if you were to run both sender and receiver on the same roscore. In an usual application, this would not be necessary.

For customization, you should copy the launch files into your own package.
