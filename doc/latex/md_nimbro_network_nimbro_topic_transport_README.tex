This package includes nodes for transmitting R\+OS topic messages over a network connection. For an overview over the available parameters, see {\ttfamily doc/configuration.\+md}.

For a quick getting-\/started guide see {\ttfamily doc/getting\+\_\+started.\+md}.

The remainder of this document introduces the features of the topic transport and explains the choices you have in detail.

The fundamental choice you have is whether you want to use the T\+CP or the U\+DP protocol.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysection{U\+DP}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md16}
The U\+DP protocol is the right choice for most R\+OS topics. It is especially suited for lossy and/or delayed connections, where T\+CP has problems. Note however, that with our U\+DP protocol there is no guarantee that a message arrives.

Typical message types transmitted using the U\+DP protocol are camera images, joystick commands, TF snapshots (see tf\+\_\+throttle). In short, everything where retransmitting missed packets does not make sense, because you have newer data available already.

For example launch files, see the launch directory.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{T\+CP}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md17}
The T\+CP protocol is more useful for topics where you need a transmission guarantee. For example, it makes sense to transmit 3D laser scans via this method, because re-\/transmission of dropped packets is still faster than waiting for the next scan.

For example launch files, see the launch directory.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{Visualization \& diagnosis}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_topic_transport_README_autotoc_md18}
The nimbro\+\_\+topic\+\_\+transport package provides G\+UI plugins for the {\ttfamily rqt} G\+UI\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}nimbro\+\_\+network/\+Topic Transport\char`\"{} shows a dot graph of all network connections
\item \char`\"{}nimbro\+\_\+network/\+Topic Bandwidth\char`\"{} shows detailed bandwidth usage for a single connection.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that it may be necessary to transmit the topics {\ttfamily /network/sender\+\_\+stats} and {\ttfamily /network/receiver\+\_\+stats} over the network to get the full amount of information.
