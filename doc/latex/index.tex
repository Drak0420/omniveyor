Wirehair \+: Fountain Codes in C++

Wirehair produces a stream of error correction blocks from a data source using an erasure code. When enough of these blocks are received, the original data can be recovered. It supports up to 64000 blocks.

This codec provides full-\/message reconstruction using the wirehair\+\_\+recover() function, and can also reconstruct single missing blocks using the wirehair\+\_\+recover\+\_\+block() function. It also accelerates retransmission in a store-\/and-\/forward system with the wirehair\+\_\+decoder\+\_\+becomes\+\_\+encoder() function.
