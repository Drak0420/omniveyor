{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+service\+\_\+transport} provides nodes which allow you to make service calls over the network.

For an overview over the available parameters, see {\ttfamily doc/configuration.\+md}.

As with the topic transport, you have the choice of using T\+CP or U\+DP as the underlying protocol.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_service_transport_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{T\+CP}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_service_transport_README_autotoc_md8}
The T\+CP protocol is very simple and straightforward. The nodes maintain a single T\+CP connection to do all service calls. For a call, one chunk of data is transmitted containing the request, and the other side answers with a chunk containing the response.

Compare this to several rounds of handshaking that the native R\+OS protocol has to do before it even gets around to transmitting the request payload...

If using T\+CP is not problematic for you, we recommend that you use the T\+CP transport for service calls.

For historical reasons, the T\+CP nodes are named {\ttfamily service\+\_\+client} and {\ttfamily service\+\_\+server}.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_service_transport_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{U\+DP}\label{md_nimbro_network_nimbro_service_transport_README_autotoc_md9}
The U\+DP transport was developed for situations where T\+CP is not usable because of the handshakes built into the protocol. It sends a single U\+DP packet for the request, and receives a single U\+DP packet as response.

If the U\+DP client does not receive a response in a user-\/defined timeout, it considers the service call as failed.

The U\+DP transport thus achieves the theoretical minimum in call latency if no packets are lost.
