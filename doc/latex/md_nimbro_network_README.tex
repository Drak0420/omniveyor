{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+network} is a set of \href{http://www.ros.org}{\texttt{ R\+OS}} packages for transporting R\+OS topics and services over network. It was developed for the \href{http://www.dlr.de/rd/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8101/13875_read-35268/}{\texttt{ D\+LR Space\+Bot\+Cup competition}} and performed very well during the competition. Our team was one of the few teams which did not have communication problems.

The Space\+Bot\+Cup network had a few special aspects which forced us to design our own network solution, in particular a two-\/second delay in each direction.

The system was also used extensively in the \href{http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/}{\texttt{ D\+A\+R\+PA Robotics Challenge}}, in which our team Nimb\+Ro Rescue achieved the fourth place.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Why?}\label{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md19}
The built-\/in network transparency of R\+OS creates a strong dependency on a good connection to the R\+OS master. Multi-\/master solutions strive to solve this issue by synchronizing individual R\+OS masters on the networked hosts.

Here is a high-\/level comparison of {\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+network} with the R\+OS network transparency and the \href{https://fkie.github.io/multimaster_fkie/}{\texttt{ multimaster\+\_\+fkie}} stack\+:

{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+network} especially targets robust operations with autonomous or semi-\/autonomous robots. Everything is statically configured, there is no auto-\/discovery which might fail at critical points during a mission.

{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+network} excels in the presence of communication restrictions (artificial or natural) like unidirectional communication, latency or packet drops.

Forward error correction (F\+EC) is realized using the \href{http://www.openfec.org/}{\texttt{ Open\+F\+EC}} software framework. This is a powerful tool to increase the robustness of the unreliable transport --- without using bidirectional communication.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md20}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Topic transport\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+CP protocol for transmission guarantee (still with communication timeouts!)
\item U\+DP protocol for streaming data (data which has no meaning if it arrives late)
\item Optional transparent \href{https://github.com/facebook/zstd}{\texttt{ zstd}} compression
\item Automatic topic discovery on the receiver side. The transmitter defines which topics get transferred
\item Optional rate-\/limiting for each topic
\item Experimental Forward Error Correction (F\+EC) for the U\+DP transport
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Service transport\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+CP protocol with minimal latency (support for T\+CP Fast-\/\+Open is included)
\item U\+DP protocol
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Additional nodes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Special nimbro\+\_\+log\+\_\+transport node for transporting the R\+OS log over a lossy connection
\item Special tf\+\_\+throttle node for creating \& transferring TF snapshots at pre-\/ defined intervals.
\item Special nimbro\+\_\+cam\+\_\+transport package for encoding/decoding camera images to/from H.\+264

{\ttfamily nimbro\+\_\+network} is mature in the sense that it has been used extensively in the preparation and during the competition of the Space\+Bot\+Cup and in the D\+A\+R\+PA Robotics Challenge.

In the D\+RC, the software was used for the high-\/bandwidth link. Communication over the low-\/bandwidth link was handled by custom, highly specific code, which is not released at this point.\hypertarget{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_nimbro_network_README_autotoc_md23}
